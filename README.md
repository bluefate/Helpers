Ramdon useful notes

# docker-compose.yml for QNAP
Helpful docker-compose sample file to use within Container Station to implement multiple dockers at the same time.
- Can be implmented via Portainer, if running, or via Create Application in the Create Tab.
- To create volume, is recommended to use Portainer since it will give you more control over the create process
